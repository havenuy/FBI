Authorities have been frustrated in their efforts to track the young woman's whereabouts following the last known sighting of her, near her apartment at E. 32nd Street and 2nd Avenue. According to an anonymous source, early leads have collapsed, leaving a cold trail. Now, a month on, the NYPD only says it is no closer to locating Ms. Wright. \n This source also intimated to the Post that a strange and disturbing collection of items had been found in Ms. Wright's apartment which was locked from the inside. Her neighbors maintain that all was fine with Ms. Wright, and nothing out of the usual had occurred to indicate she was in danger or planning to leave."
